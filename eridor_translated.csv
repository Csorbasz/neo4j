Nutrient Runoff: Excessive nutrient runoff from poorly managed soils can contaminate water supplies with nitrates and phosphates, leading to waterborne diseases and other health problems.  2. Foodborne Illness  Pathogen Contamination: Soil health affects the prevalence of pathogens like E. coli and Salmonella. Poor soil management can increase the risk of contamination, leading to foodborne illnesses when crops are consumed.  3. Respiratory Issues  Dust and Particulate Matter: Poor soil management practices can lead to increased soil erosion and airborne dust, which can cause respiratory problems for farmworkers and nearby communities.  4. Nutritional Deficiencies  Soil Degradation: Degraded soils often yield crops with lower nutritional value. This can contribute to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals in populations that rely heavily on those crops for their diets.  5. Ecosystem Health Impact  Biodiversity Loss: Unsustainable soil practices can lead to a decline in biodiversity, which can disrupt ecosystem services such as pollination and natural pest control, potentially leading to increased pesticide use and its associated health risks.  6. Climate Change Effects  Increased Food Insecurity: Climate change exacerbates food risk, leading to more unpredictable food supply and quality.

Positive hemagglutination inhibition tests were also found in the North American population, but due to the few positive samples and other reasons, the presence of the influenza D virus in the human population is not yet clear.  Influenza is detected in animals using the PCR method based on the type A virus, which is therefore currently not suitable for detecting the type D of influenza. Method developments of this nature are underway.
